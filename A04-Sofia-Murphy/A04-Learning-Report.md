	For this project, the main thing I implemented was a Robot class which draws the robot and controls its rotation. In order to control the robot’s rotations, I set up a pointer float variable which would contain the rotation angles of each body part. This variable would then be used in the rotation method, which would alter the angle of the current matrix by 15 degrees.   
Another major aspect implemented within the Robot class is the draw method. This method draws each body part of the robot, and also controls the coordinate systems of each. The parent of each quadrant of the robot, either the upper or lower torso, first pushes its matrix. This will be the setup for the use of transformations in the robot. Next, a translation is called based on the coordinates of the current parent object. Something I wanted to implement but didn’t have time to would be a non-hardcoded way of setting up these translations. Currently, I calculated the x and y coordinates of the translation based on the coordinates of the parent object, however as this is a hardcoded solution it is not as flexible as it could be. Additionally, the pivot points for the objects are also slightly different from the diagram in the assignment, however they are for the most part oriented correctly.   
For each object in the draw method, if it is the parent object of another its matrix is also pushed, though it is popped before the overall parent object. These minor parents also apply translations to their children's objects. For every object, the current rotational angle is applied.   
Something else I would have liked to implement but didn’t have time to, would be converting the rectangles of the robot to other shapes, using the GL primitives rather than OpenGl’s rectangle method, as I feel that would allow for more flexibility with changing the pivot points of the robot.   
Another method implemented in the Robot class is the keyboard method. This method controls how the robot’s body parts are selected, as well as how they are rotated. The different body parts are selected with W and S, with W going up the indices of the robot, and S going down the indices of the robot. Additionally, in this method the color of the selected robot part is changed. The current selected part is changed to a red color, and the previously selected part is reset to its previous color. A bug here that I didn’t have enough time to fix was that the first body part selected, the lower torso, doesn’t change color on loading the program. The user will need to press W or S first to change the color of the current selected body part.   
I also implemented two helper methods, getRandFloat and getCenterPoint. getRandFloat generates a random float between a maximum and minimum value. I used this method when generating the robot’s colors. Then, for getCenterPoint, it calculates the  point between two points. I mainly used this method to calculate the pivot points of the robot’s limbs.   
Finally, I created a robot object in main, and then called its draw method in the display function in main. I also called the robot’s keyboard method within the keyboard function of main.
